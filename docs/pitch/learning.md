# Learning of my pitches

## First when I was at Rutger

- Very first pitch
- Focus on the fact that my app solves the information overload problem
- Focus on how priority is decided
- Bring more focus to the product and other competitors
- Explain that the circumstances influence the task
- Tell that computers are in our lives to make everything easier
- Using the vacation story, explain how the product would have prevented it
- Explain that "tasklists" get a critical mass at some point which makes them unwieldly.

## After a few months of developement

- Everything involving time (waiting until) feels like a bad idea.
    - Mostly because it allows postponing simply for the purpose of delaying.
      I personally feel like that is not what the app is all about. The app is
      about increasing productivity.
- Something else I notices is that I want to know how well I have done in the
  past few days/months. It would be cool if I would just get an overview of all
  the things I have done.
- The one feature I would really like to see gone is the scoring (at least the
  visual part). I know the purpose (or do I?) but I don't think it adds
  anything for the average consumer.
