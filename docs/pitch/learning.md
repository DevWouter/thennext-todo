# Learning of my pitches

## First when I was at Rutger

- Very first pitch
- Focus on the fact that my app solves the information overload problem
- Focus on how priority is decided
- Bring more focus to the product and other competitors
- Explain that the circumstances influence the task
- Tell that computers are in our lives to make everything easier
- Using the vacation story, explain how the product would have prevented it
- Explain that "tasklists" get a critical mass at some point which makes them unwieldly.
